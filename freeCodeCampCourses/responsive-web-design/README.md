# Responsive Web Design Certification

Welcome to the Responsive Web Design Certification repository! This repository contains code and projects from the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Couse](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). In this certification, you'll learn the fundamental languages used by developers to create webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

Comments added to the code are my own, and added for learning pourposes.
